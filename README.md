# House Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my machine learning project focused on predicting house prices. The main goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately predict prices based on various features. This project includes a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the implementation of three distinct models for comparison.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I started by thoroughly exploring the dataset to gain insights into its characteristics. This involved analyzing data distributions, handling outliers, addressing missing values, and visualizing key trends. EDA played a pivotal role in guiding subsequent modeling decisions and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Model Comparison
For this project, three machine learning models were implemented: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. Each model was chosen based on its suitability for the task and potential to capture underlying patterns in the data. I trained and evaluated each model, comparing their performance metrics to determine the most effective model for price prediction.

## Results
After a detailed comparison, the Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most accurate model for predicting prices. Performance metrics, including the mean of Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) after 200-fold Cross-Validation, indicated its superior capability in capturing dataset patterns. This model has been selected as the final choice for price prediction in this project.

## Future Steps
As this is my initial machine learning project, there is ample room for improvement. In the future, I plan to explore additional feature engineering techniques, experiment with more advanced models, and optimize the selected model further to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project marks my entry into the field of machine learning. Through EDA and model comparison, I gained valuable insights into the dataset and identified a robust model for predicting house prices. This experience serves as a foundation for future projects and continuous learning in the exciting realm of machine learning.
